# Quiz & Flashcard for EPL

## Goals

I want to build a simple yet useful and helpful "webapp" that will help students memorize some flashcard. It's like a quizlet but free and open-source.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Develop an algorithm to help with learning and tracking progress of the student
- [ ] Polish the tkinter interface
- [ ] Migrate the JS logic to flask
- [ ] Make it more versatile and storing a big database of questions that students can use
